A couple of days ago I was talking to an artist that is part of the administration board of a local Art Gallery. After telling her what I do and what Hinterland Web is all about. She mentioned that in the last meeting, the board was not keen on investing in a website, but rather use the power of social media to promote the the work and events of the the Art Gallery.

## Why do brands still need a website in 2024?

While I also agreed with her, that nowadays people spend most of their time on Social Media, this fact got me really thinking. Will there be a shift?

The Internet has evolved in unimaginable ways since the very first website was launched back in 1991 and website are sill, more than ever the essential building blocks of this technology and in an era dominated by social media and mobile apps, you might wonder if having a website is still necessary. The short answer? ABSOLUTELY!

A well-designed website serves as the cornerstone of your online presence, providing a platform that you fully control. Unlike social media platforms where you're at the mercy of someone else's algorithm, your website gives you the freedom to create content and showcase your products or services exactly as you envision.

Moreover, a website is essential for building trust with potential customers. It serves as a 24/7 digital brochure, offering valuable information about your business, its history, and its offerings. This approach ensures that your audience can access information about your and your brand at any time, enhancing your credibility and professional image.

Let's explore three simple reasons websites remain crucial in 2024 and how they can benefit your business or personal brand.

## 1. Relevance

Despite the rise of social platforms, websites continue to be the cornerstone of a strong online presence and the best way to showcase what you do. A website gives you unparalleled control over your digital identity and provide a central hub for all your online activities and can me constantly optimised. Unlike social media, where you're at the mercy of algorithms and platform changes, your website is yours to manage and customise as you see fit.

Moreover, websites are essential for establishing credibility. In 2024, consumers expect businesses to have a professional online presence. A well-designed website signals legitimacy and helps build trust with potential customers or clients.

While platforms like social media are important, they can't replace the functionality and control offered by a custom-developed website. Website development allows you to create a digital presence that perfectly aligns with your brand identity and business needs. It provides the flexibility to implement unique features and functionalities that set you apart from competitors.

Moreover, as your business grows and evolves, a custom website can be easily adapted to meet your changing needs. This scalability is crucial for businesses looking to expand their online presence and capabilities over time.

## 2. Ownership 

The Art Gallery I mentioned before wants to focus on social media instead. While social media is undoubtedly important, it shouldn't be your sole focus. Social platforms are excellent for engagement and brand awareness, but they have limitations. You don't own your social media profiles, and your content is subject to each platform's rules and algorithms.

A website, on the other hand, gives you complete control over your content and the way you create content and how it's presented. It also allows you to implement powerful SEO strategies to improve your visibility in search engine results, driving organic traffic to your business.

This is often an overlooked advantage of having a website: the superior quality of leads it can generate. Visitors to your website are typically there with intent and not just doom-scrolling. They've actively searched for your services or products, indicating a higher level of interest and engagement. This targeted traffic often translates to higher-quality leads and better conversion rates. Furthermore, through strategic content placement and SEO optimisation, you can attract visitors at various stages of the buying process, from those just beginning their research to those ready to make a purchase. At the end of the day you want your target audience to feel at home and a website optimised for search engines can help increase your brand's visibility in Google searches related to your industry or offerings. This increased visibility can lead to greater brand recognition and recall among your target audience.

## 3. Uniqueness

Websites offer several unique advantages:

- Complete customization of you business needs: Tailor your online presence to perfectly reflect your brand.
- In-depth content: Share detailed information about your products, services, or expertise.
- E-commerce capabilities: Sell products directly to customers without intermediaries.
- Data ownership: Collect and analyze visitor data to inform your business decisions.
- Integration possibilities: Implement Automations to streamline your business processes.

Perhaps most importantly, websites allow you to create a seamless user experience. You can guide visitors through your content, products, or services in a way that's impossible on social media platforms.

By providing valuable information and clear calls-to-action on your website, you can nurture these leads effectively, guiding them through your sales funnel. This level of lead qualification and nurturing is difficult to achieve solely through social media or third-party platforms, making your website an invaluable tool for generating high-quality leads that are more likely to convert into customers.

Your website plays a crucial role in building and maintaining brand awareness. It serves as a consistent representation of your brand online, showcasing your logo, colours, and overall aesthetic. Through quality content and effective brand storytelling, you can communicate your brand's values, mission, and unique selling propositions.
